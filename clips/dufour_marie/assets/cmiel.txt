My name is Nat Cmiel
I am 22 years old
I like music, dancing ballet
Crushing up rocks and snorting them
And genderless people
I like to eat, but I don't like it when it lingers on my body
I like to take up as little space as possible
I like pretty textures in sound
I like the way some music makes me feel
I like making up my own worlds
And the people who live inside me
I like to dress up and not going out
I like my cat, Miso
I like touching myself
And I like being far away from my own body
I like sweet things, physical and consumable
I like short sentences that say everything I felt at one go
I like obsessing over people and then throwing them away
I like being a boy, I like being a girl
I like getting fucked, and I like to fuck
I like to be pure
I like believing there's a cure
But, most of all, I-
