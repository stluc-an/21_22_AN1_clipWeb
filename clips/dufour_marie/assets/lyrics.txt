30	It's a fucking mess 
34	(You're the one who can't talk)
38	I just don't know what to say 
42	(Go back to sleep)
44	You know what they always say when you do all that kind of stuff
50	They always try and get back at you somehow
57	(You can always try) I can't do anything right
62	(You can always be alive some other time)
69	(You don't have to live, right now)
72	It's time I did something right
76	(Don't have to wake up)
78	Why not?
85	Well, you can just lie here, with me
99	Just, me and you
109	And you and me, and me and you

206	Mandy
210	Mandy
214	And so, It's like I can't even trust
218	I can't even trust myself, so
227	I don't love you anymore 
230	(Mandy!)
233	Don't love you (Mandy!)
238	(Mandy!)
241	I said, I don't!
250	We'll make it go away
258	The pain can go away
266	They said it'd go away
273	With Mandy
278	Mandy
